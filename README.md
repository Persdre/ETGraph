- Encoded graphs for matching link prediction:


This repository contains three code folders and two data files. The folders are organized as follows:

1. Ethereum link prediction
2. Wash trading address detection
3. Matching link prediction

The data files included in this repository are:

1. Twitter handles with their matching Ethereum addresses (before anonymization for review; the formal version will be anonymized)
2. Wash-trading records from Dune (before anonymization for review; the formal version will be anonymized)
